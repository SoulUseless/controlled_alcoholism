									I have always been interested in the Glendronach lineup, but it was not so high up on my wishlist that I would really jump onto the opportunity to purchase one. So, when I found a seller selling a dram of this, I took the chance to get one dram to try it out...

									I made it pretty clear that the Hibiki Lineup by Suntory always holds a special place in my heart as I consider it to be my gateway into the wide world of whisky appreciation. As such, I would always have a set of Hibiki's on my shelf, squirreled away. However, due to the immense demand from Japanese Whiskies these few years (could be a topic for another article), I purchased those bottles at a pretty significant markup. Thus, even though I have the bottles and whisky, I could never really bear to open up the bottles and drink it. Thus, whenever I could realistically purchase a sip of this, I would not hesitate to jump on the opportunity to do so...

						Alcohol carries a strong negative connotation of partying, drunkedness and overindulgence, especially in people my age. I hope to turn that notion around and shed light on the culture behind alcohol and prove that it is not as deleterious as it first appears.
